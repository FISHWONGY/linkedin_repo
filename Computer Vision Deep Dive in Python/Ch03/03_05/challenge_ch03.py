# Task #1: Print a color image
#
# Copy an image file of your own in this folder,
# open it and display it.

# Write your code here

# Task #2: Convert the color image to grayscale.
#
# Use the weights we used before:
#                              Red: 0.299
#                            Green: 0.587
#                             Blue: 0.114
#

# Write your code here

# Task #3: Plot a histogram
#
# In this cell, plot a histogram of your grayscale image
# and try to come up with a suitable global threshold.

# Write your code here

# Task #4: Compare two Black and White Images
#
# Pick two global thresholds from the histogram above and compare
# the two resulting images.
# Feel free to use OpenCV or grayscale_to_BW() from EC_CV.py

# Write your code here
