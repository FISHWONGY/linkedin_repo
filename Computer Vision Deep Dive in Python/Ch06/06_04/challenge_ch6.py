# Task #1: Choose a pair of images to stitch
#
# Copy two image files of your own in this folder,
# open and display them both.
#
# These two images must have the same height, and must
# be suitable for stitching together.

# Write your code here

# Task #2: Find a suitable overlap for the 2 images and create a seam.
#
# In this cell, find an appropriate overlap for your images.
# This can be a number as small as 10 pixels, or as large as 100 pixels.
# It all depends on your pictures' resolution.
#
# Then produce an appropriate seam and display it.
# You may do this in several cells.

# Write your code here

# Task #3: Stitch the images together.
#
# In this cell, put it all together.
# You may use 3 sections like I did.
# Display the final image.

# Write your code here

"""## See any unnatural artifacts? 
## Try again with a different overlap.
